### Ingredients

- 4 tilapia fillets
- 1 cup milk
- 1/2 cup avocado oil
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/2 cup flour
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp chili powder

### Instructions

1. Cut tilapia into nugget-sized chunks, put them in a bowl, and pour milk over them.
1. Put oils together in a pan and heat on medium-high.
1. Mix flour, salt, paprika, and chili powder in a large container you can cover
   with a lid and shake, like a tupperware.
1. Place tilapia pieces into container with the flour. Discard any excess milk.
1. Cover container and shake to coat the tilapia with the flour mixture.
1. Once the oil is hot, use tongs to transfer tilapia to pan and fry until golden brown (~3 min per side).
1. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to cool.

### Notes

These are great in or out of tacos, especially with a spicy mayo sauce
of 3 parts mayo to 1 part sriracha. I use individually-sealed frozen
tilapia fillets, which you can thaw under some running water in about 5
minutes. That makes them a great backup when it's dinnertime and I
realize there's nothing in the fridge.
