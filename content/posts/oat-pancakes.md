### Ingredients

- 1 cup oats
- 4 egg whites
- 2 whole eggs
- 1/4 cup milk
- 2 ripe bananas

### Instructions

1. Heat a pan or skillet on medium-high heat.
1. Blend ingredients together in a blender until smooth.
1. Pour into pan to make desired size of pancakes.
1. Flip when you see bubbles, and then remove when both sides have desired browning.

### Notes

I add a few handfuls of spinach to turn these into "Shrek Pancakes". Aside from
the color, you don't really notice the spinach, and my son loves them.
