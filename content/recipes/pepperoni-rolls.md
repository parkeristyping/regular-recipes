### Ingredients

- 2 cups whole milk
- 2.5 tsp active dry yeast
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1.5 tsp salt
- 16oz pepperoni (sliced or cut into 3.5" x 0.5" sticks)
- Melted butter

### Instructions

1. Warm milk to 105-110°F.
1. Add yeast and sugar to warm milk and stir.
1. Add flour and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk a few times to
   combine.
1. Once the yeast mixture is very foamy (10 min or so), slowly add it the flour
   while mixing with a dough hook on the lowest setting.
1. Continue mixing for 5 min. The dough should come together into a not-too-sticky ball.
1. Let the dough rise covered in a large, oiled bowl for 2 hours. It should at
   least double in size.
1. Uncover, press the dough down, re-cover, and allow to rise for another hour.
1. Pre-heat oven to 350°F.
1. Split dough into 10 equally sized balls and allow to rest for 15 min.
1. On a floured surface, flatten each ball of dough into a circle 5" across.
1. Make the rolls. Each roll should have 3 sticks of pepperoni (or 10 slices, in 2 rows). Roll
   the dough around the pepperoni so there's dough between the sticks (or rows
   of slices).
1. Place on an oiled baking sheet and brush the rolls with melted butter.
1. Bake for 30 min.
